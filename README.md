# 👋 Hi, I'm Bhargavi Baichwal  

Welcome to my GitHub! This is where I upload everything I’m learning and building from **Python practice and LeetCode solutions** to **AWS projects**, **Databricks workflows**, and experiments with **Apache Spark**.  
Think of this space as my personal **tech lab** 🧪 where I explore ideas, sharpen problem solving skills, and grow as a **Data Engineer**.  

---

## 🚀 Why this GitHub?
I wanted a single place where I can:  
- 📌 Track my progress while learning and practicing Python & algorithms.  
- ☁️ Experiment with **cloud-native projects on AWS** (Lambda, Glue, Redshift, S3, etc.).  
- 🔥 Work on **Databricks & Spark** projects for scalable data pipelines and analytics.  
- 📖 Document my **problem-solving journey with LeetCode** and other challenges.  

This repo collection is less about polished, “finished” code and more about **continuous learning and experimentation**.

## 💡 What you’ll find here
- 🐍 **Python snippets & exercises** → covering data structures, algorithms, and daily problem-solving.  
- ☁️ **AWS Projects** → serverless pipelines, event-driven architectures, automation.  
- 🧩 **Databricks & Spark Projects** → SQL, PySpark, and big data exploration.  
- 🔗 **LeetCode & HackerRank** solutions → practicing for cleaner, faster, and scalable problem-solving.

## 🛠 Skills I’m sharpening
Based on my experience & resume:  
- **Languages** → Python, Scala, Advanced SQL  
- **Big Data** → Spark, Hadoop, Hive, Kafka, Databricks  
- **Cloud** → AWS (Lambda, Glue, Redshift, S3, CloudWatch, IAM, SQS, RDS)  
- **DevOps & CI/CD** → Jenkins, GitHub Actions  
- **Orchestration** → Apache Airflow, Autosys  
- **Databases** → MySQL, Delta Tables, Data Modeling
